These are the codes which I have used during my research endeavors. The codes written in R were some of the earliest that I wrote, and so they are not well organized. The Henon
Map code, and the turbulent boundary layer codes are being constantly updated as they are part of my current research projects. The FORTRAN programs all have the same name due to
the compiler I used (Code::Blocks), so they are stored in separate folders. The catching the front codes were used in the Stefan problem papers of the appropriate geometry, and
the R codes were used for the Spherical geometry Stefan problem paper. The Boris Pusher folder includes the code which I wrote for my SULI and the theory booklet that I wrote for
it. The Laminar_BL code is explained in the Math Methods project 2 paper, it is simply a Python rendition of the laminar boundary layer equations discretized in a grid with
variable steps.
