This is a collection of all the drafts and papers that I am working on, or have worked on. Not all of them are complete, or submitted. Dr. Sakhnov's "Local laminarization within 
the mild pressure gradient flow over the heated wall" specifically is a paper which I am only acknowledged due to correcting some issues with the text. It is, however, closely 
related to my ongoing computational fluid dynamics project (the code for which is located in this repository's "codes" folder) that I have taken on with Dr. Sakhnov.
